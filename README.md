New York City is a well known to be one of the most expensive cities in the world to buy real estate.  In this project, we will use a year's (September 2016 to September 2017) worth of data provided by City of New York on properties sold on the NYC real estate market. This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.  The purpose of this project is to predict house prices using these data such as Borough, Neighborhood, Building Class, etc. We will explore the correlations, and clean and isolate any potential outliers. After doing so, the data will be fitted with different models such as Linear Model, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, GBM.
